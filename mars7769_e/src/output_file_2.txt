founder of psychology - wilhem wundt

strcuturalism - Titchener, all exeperience could be reduced to basic elements like chemistry

functionalism - William James, how mental processes function - not structure how do we use our mental processes to adapt/survive

gestalt - Max wertheimer, the whole is better than the sum of its parts - looks at the bigger picture rather than the breakdown

psychology is considered a science

goals of psychology 
	description - what
	explanation - why 
	prediciton - when will this happen
	control - manipulate or change outcomes 

methods of descriptive study: observation
	naturalistic - watching kids playing at the park
	laboratory - lab testing or experimenting

case study is a selected or limited group of people and have a low sample size and low generalizability

derive a hypothesis - a prediction

independent varible = the one that the experimenter changes
dependent variable = the one that the experimentor measures/records

experimental group receives the manipulation
control group does not get the manipulation

limitations = selection bias in the study (ex. similar group of people not enough diversity)
fix for selection bias = random selection or random assignment ( being in control groupd or experimental group)

placebo effect - (feel the effects of experimentation without acctually experienceing anything)
double blind technique - when both the expermentor and the experimented dont know what the experiment entitles until it is time

hawsthorne effect - acting differently because you know you are being experimented

analyzing data - 2 approaches
	descriptive - makes a summary and shares information about our findings
	inferential - infers a conclusion based on the experiment data

measure variability - not everyone will preform the same, variability gives you a spread out of the scores from the mean 

little variability - all bunched up close to the mean (average)
lots of variability - parabolic results
standard deviation - measure of the disperion or scatter of results

measures of central tendencies
	mean, median, and mode

correlation - how two things relate to eachother
	positive - one varible goes up so does the other (study time and grades)
	negative - one varible goes up the other goes down (porn usage and mental health)

inferential statistics - analyzing data using statstical sets that allow the researcher to make a conclusion about whether a hypothesis was supported by the results ("reliable or "not important")

neurons - cells that carry messages throughout the nervous sytem

types of neurons
	afferent - senes to the brain
	efferent - brain to the senses
	interneurons - carry information between neurons

anatomy
cell body
dendrites
axons
myelin sheath
nodes of ranvier
terminal buttons

glials cells act like glue that hold neurons together

all or none law - neurons either fire or they dont

synapse - where neurons meet
axon terminal
synaptic vesicles
sacs
stores chemicals
neurotransmitters
transmit info between neurons
synaptic cleft
gap
neurons dont touch

neurotransmitter - think of a lock and key

agonist - blakc widow spider poison, excites - increases firing
antagonist curare, epposes - decreases firing

monoamine neurotransmitters
dopamine - feel good, excites and inhibits mood, too much = schizo, too little = parkinsons
norepinephrine - sympathetic nervous sytem - arousal/alertness (FEAR!!!)
serotonin - regulates mood, sleep and appetite

meds to treat monoamine disorders
anti depressants 
MAO inhibitors
SSRIs

neurotransmitters
GABA - sleep, reduces arousal
Glutamate - learning, memory and other functions
Endorphins - relieve pain and produce feelings of pleasure

nervous system 
central nervous system 
brain
spinal cord
peripheral nervous sytem 
somatic nervous system - emotions and response
autonomic nervous system - auto functions like breathing
sympathetic nervous system - firing 
parasympathetic nervous sytem - calming

the brain
hindbrain - handle evryhting automatic
medulla: closest to spinal cord controls heartbeat, breathing, blood pressure)
cerebellum: deep convolutions, controls bodily balance and muscular coordination
pons: swallowing, breathing, eyes, face 


midbrain - reticular formation 
regulates attention and alertness
substantia nigra connects hind with fore brain 
procudes dopamine


forebrain - subcortical and cortex
thalmus: relay system for all sensory information 
hypothalumus: regulation of basic biological needs ( 4 F's: fighting, fleeing, feeding, fucking)
pituitary gland: hormone creation, growth, and reproduction
limbic system: amygdala - emotion/fear, hippocampus - memory
basal ganglia: reward centre
cerebral cortex (wraps around top of brain) - language, memory, thinking
cerebrum: made up of left and right hemispheres
lobes
frontal - planning and movement
parietal - sense of touch, position in space
occipital - visual cortex (not in depth images)
temporal - primary auditory cortex

corpus collosum connects the two hemispheres

sides of the brain:
left - language, mathematics, analytical, sequential
right - visual, spatial, holistic, "hear", creativity, intuition

think of it as things happening on the left of your body are controlled by the opposite side of your brain

broca's area - speech
wernicke's area - language comprehension

plasticity - ability of the brain to reconstrcut and repair from damage

imaging techniques
EEG electroenephalogram: measures electrical activity in the brain - sticking the little things on your head
CT scan: x-ray type images, may require dye
MRI: magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnet scans and builds a 2d or 3d image, very clear
Imaging PET: smalls does ot radioactive substance injected, different colours indicate different tissue
Imaging fMRI: based on the amount of oxygen in the blood, uses magnets as well

what is learning? - process by which experience produces a relatively enduring change in behaviour or capabilities

Behaviourism - focused on how organisms learn, processes by which experience influences behaviour

condition - classical (pavlovian or respondent), operant (skinnerian or instrumental)

classical conditioning - learned by association based on your responses to occurring stimuli, some things initiate a response
UCS unconditioned stimulus - elicits a reflexitive or innate response without prior learning (food, drooling)
UCR = unconditioned response 
CS = conditioned stimulus - through association with ucs becomes conditioned to a response
CR = conditioned response

pavlov studied dog exeriment - everytime he fed the dogs he would ring a bell and then the dogs started associating the bell with food and began salivating

acquisiton = training the learned response, forward short, simultaneous, backward
extinction = reducing or removing the learned behaviours
spontaneous recovery = after a while the conditioned response comes back after not affecting the subject
generalization = stimuli similar to intial CS but not the same elicit a CR
discrimination = CR occurs to one stimuls but not another

higher order condition has 2 cs's

operant conditioning - behaviour changes as a result fo the consequnces follwing unlike classical in which the behaviour changes due to stimuli
throndikes law of effect - response followed by a satisfying consequence becomes more likely to occur and the opposite for unsatifying

positive reinforcement increases the behaviour, adds to the environment ex given candy for a deed
positive punishment descrease behviour, add to environment in forms of a slap or punch

negative reinforcement increase behviour, remove from environment ex buzzer 
negative punishment decrease behaviour, remove from environment ex time out, no tv

continous reinforcement - every response is reinforced
partial reinforcement - only some responses are reinforced

schedules 
ratio - certain percentage of responses are reinforced
interval - certain amount of time must elapse between reinforcements
fixed - reinforcement occurs after a fixed number of responses or fixed time interval 
variable - reinforcement occurs after an average number of responses or passage of time

consciousness = moment to moment awareness of ourselves and environment
subjective and private - others cannot knw your reality
dynamic - changing
self reflective - aware of being aware

blindsight - a condition where people are still able to process visual stimuli while being blind because of damage to their visual cortex
inattentional blindessness - missing something obvious because you are so focused on one thing

circadian rythms - the natural sleep wake cylce, neurons are active during daytime and melatonin is secreted, then become inactive at night and meltonin is released

sleeping - cycle through stages every 90 minutes
4 types of waves - aplha, relaxed - beta, active - theta, light sleep - delta, deep sleep

stages of sleep 
stage 1: light sleep , theta waves, experience body jerks
stage 2: sleep deepens, muscles relax, burst of brain activity
stage 3: regular appearance of delta waves
stage 4: delta waves dominate and can now cycle through other stages
REM sleep - rapid eyemovement, high arousal, vivid dreams, heart rate increases, erections

the older we get the less sleep we need, time in stages 3 and 4 declines

sleep deprivation - not sleeping enough, impacts mood and cognitive abilities, takes several nights to recover

sleep disorders:
insomnia - cant fall asleep
sleep apnea - breathing stops and you wake up
narcolepsy - suddenly fall asleep randomly

freuds psychoanalytical theory - wish fulfillment, gratification of unconscious desires / needs 
hypnosis - state of being controlled - no scientific evidence to support this

agonists - drug binds to receptor and activates it
antagonists - reduces neurons ability to sythesize or release transmitter

drug tolerance - needing more of the drug to achieve same effect
compensatory responses - reactions opposite to that of the drugs intended use
withdrawal - urge for drug afetr stopping use

types of drugs:
depressants - decrease nervous sytem activity, reduce anxiety (alcohol)
stimulants - increase natural firing and arouse nervous system, increase blood pressure, heart rate, and alertness (cocaine)
opiods - opium poppy, ex morphine, pain killers, mood chnages and creates euphoric state, highly addictive
hallucinogens - many derived from natural sources, blur boundaries between reality and fantasy

personality - distinctive and relatively enduring ways of thinking, feeling, and acting, that characterize a perons's response to situations

personality assessment - need explicit coding system , specific behaviour, frequency, specific situations
personality scales - uses standard questions based on agreen upon scoring key, collects lot of data, validity of aswsers vary

traits - identifying the  number of traits, are they from environemtn or genetic
modern testing ahs 5 personality traits - NEO-PI-R, neuroticism, extraversion, opennes, agreeableness, conscientiousness

summoning trait ideas - stables, observable, genetic/environmental

psychdynamic - what people say and do are the tip of the iceberg, motives and desires lie beneath

freud and psycholanalytical approach - how much of your activities and thoughts do you control? how much is automatic? sussy theory, sexuality is a primary drive and children have sexual feelings

conscious - aware and attention 
preconscious - events out of awareness that can be recalled
unconscious - primary motivating force of behaviour, contains repressed memories, instincts and wihses that have never been allowed into consciousness

personality has 3 systems:
id - devil on the shoulder, temptations
ego - the logical, rational, realistic part of the personality
superego - morality aspect of personality, intially reflects parents' expectations

ego cannot always control id and complications can arise
defence mechanisms - individual is unaware of them, ex repression, revealed in your dreams and slips of the tongue

freud's psychosexual development - important factor influencing personality is the sex instinct

unconscious processes - nonconscious processes ahve been demonstrated
psychosexual stages - concept of childhood sexuality rejected

critics - freud overemphasized infantile sexuality, childhood experiences were important but not sole determinants

humanists - the optimists
humanistic approaches - maslow, sees other theories as a deficit based model, what about seeking things for self gain

carl rogers self theory - consistent set of perceptions and beliefs about oneself
development of self-concept - child needs unconditional positive regard to develop self worth, "i love you you but i dont like what you did"
narcissim - "all about me" driven to maintain overly-high, positive self-concept

trephining to realse demons, cutting a hole in the skull

assessing abnormal behaviour - stistical definition, frequency, how common are certain traits?

mental illness 
neurosis - causes personal distress and some impairment in functioning, stil in check with reality
psychosis - severe, lose touch of reality, delusions, hallucinations

types of psychological disorders:
anxiety - unrealistic anxiety, feeling something bad is about to happen
types of anxiety disorders:
generalized axiety disorder - excessive anxiety and worry 6 months or more
panic disorder - recurrent, unpredictable anxiety attacks, pounding heart, uncontrollable trembling
phobias - persistent, irrational fear of an object, situation, or activity
ocd - obessions, persistent, recurring, involuntary thoughts, images, or impulses that invade consciousness

depression
emotional symptoms - sadness, hopelessness, anxiety
cognitive symptoms - negative cognitions about self, world
motivational symptoms - loss of interest, lack of drive
somatic symptoms - loss of appetite, energy, weight gain

major depression can lead to suicidal thoughts, cause delusions or hallucinations

bipolar - experiences two radically different moods, very high highs, and terrible lows

schizophrenia:
delusions - paranoid, think others are talking to them
speech disturbances - make up words, string sounds
disorders of thought - sudden interruption, hard to link logical thoughts
hallucinations - auditory and visual
emotional disturbances - incongruent and innapropriate
behaviours - bizzare, disorganized, can act violently

etiology - the study of causation of diseases

personality disorders -  begins in childhood or adolescence, tend to have problems in their relationships and at work

odd behviour - lacks social skills, odd ideas, different wardrobe, poor social relationships

antisocial personality disorder - disregard for others, exploit others, lie - no remorse
anxious/fearful - dependent on others, clingy, fear abandonment

dissociative identity - more then one personality, different memories, different behaviours

somatoform disorders - belief that you are ill or disabled
conversion disorder - condition in which a person experiences physical and sensory problems, such as paralysis, numbness, blindness, deafness or seizures, with no underlying neurologic pathology

catharsis - explore feelings that have been bottled up for fear or punishment/retaliation
gestalt therapy - bring feelings, wishes, and thoughts into awareness to feel whole again
person centred therapy - all about the person and promoting healthy growth in the individual
cognitive therapies - change the way you think

aaron beck and albert elilis - rational emotive therapy, people hold beliefs that cause problems to be seen or interpreted in the world 

behavioural therapies - maladaptive behaviours can be unlearned through claddical and operant conditioning

exposure therapies - exposure, flooding, implosion, 

aversion therapy - association of an unpleasant response with substance use 

token economies - strengthend desired behaviours, token given for disrable behaviours

drug therapy - target neurotransmitters, antidepressants, anti-anxiety, mood stabilizers

electroconvulsive therapy - useful in treating severe, persistent, depression (electrodes on your head) gives short shock causing a seziure
possible memory loss or brain damage

 

Other Stimulation Techniques 

vagus nerve (longest nerve) - invasive, electrical pulse, impacts mood centres 

 

transcranial magnetic stimulation coil – current, presented non-invasive 

psychosurgery - mehtod of last resort, destorys or remove parts of the brain, permamnent

when to seek therapy - severe emotional discomfort, unable to handle problems or life transition, thinking about, dreaming about, or responding to a traumatic, event with negative emotions
